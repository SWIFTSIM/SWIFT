 *
 * This is the zoom specific form of engine_makeproxies. Unlike the uniform
 * box proxies we don't ahead of time know exactly which cells will end up
 * having direct interactions. Instead we just need to make sure all that
 * could interact do have a proxy, so we use a brute force loop over all
 * possible pairs of cells. This will account for any possible inter-cell grid
 * interactions.
