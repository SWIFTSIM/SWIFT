#  Gitlab pipeline for SWIFT, defines the various jobs that could be ran by a

#
#  Should only run on non-draft merge requests or pushes to the master branch,
#  either directly or from a merge request. Some of this logic is repeated in
#  the jobs.

#  Keep to the smaller job on MR branches and activate for all pushes to the
#  master branch. Don't do anything on draft MRs.

#  We just build, that is a job is lots of compilations and tests.  Those
#  could be separated but tests would need to keep artefacts to preserve
#  context with the compilations, and we have a lot of builds based on
#  configure options, so each would need to be handled. That would be
#  inefficient as the artefacts are uploaded to the gitlab and then
#  retrieved.
