# Context

This example tests the dynamical friction implemented in the MWPotential2014.
It compares the orbit predicted by SWIFT with an orbit computed with pNbody, using:

`orbits_integration_MW --t_forward 10 --position 0.1 0.1 100 --velocity 80 0 0 --dynamical_friction -o orbit.csv`

# How to run this example

In a terminal at the root of the "swiftsim" directory, type:

`./autogen.sh`

Then, configure swift to take into account external potentials. Type:

`./configure --with-ext-potential=MWPotential2014`

Feel free to adapt other configurations parameters depending on your system. Then, build the code by typing:

`make`

Finally, to run this example, open a terminal in the present directory and type:

`./run.sh`

In this last command run Swift run on two different parameter files, params_unit_1.yml and params_unit_2.yml.
Those two sets of parameters only differ by the choice of the internal units. This allow to test the correct 
units conversion of all parameters involved.
