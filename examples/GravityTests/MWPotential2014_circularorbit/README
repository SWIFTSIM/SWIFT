# How to run this example

In a terminal at the root of the "swiftsim" directory, type:

`./autogen.sh`

Then, configure swift to take into account external potentials. Type:

`./configure --with-ext-potential=MWPotential2014`

Feel free to adapt other configurations parameters depending on your system. Then, build the code by typing:

`make`

Finally, to run this example, open a terminal in the present directory and type:

`./run.sh`
