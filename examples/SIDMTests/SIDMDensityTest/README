ICs extracted from the EAGLE suite of simulations. 

The particle distribution here is the snapshot 27 (z=0.1) of the 6.25Mpc
Ref-model. h- and a- factors from the original Gadget code have been
corrected for. Variables not used in a pure hydro & gravity code have
been removed. 

This test adapts the initial conditions to produce two independent runs. One
with only gas particles and the other with only dark matter particles.

The goal of the test is to compare the density and smoothing lengths calculations
of the dark matter particles over a cosmological setting. If everything is done
correctly, the density and smoothing lengths of the gas and dark matter should match.

The simulations are run for a single time step, gravity is turned off artificially. The only
important computation during the time step are densities and smoothing lengths.

To reproduce this test do the following. 

1) Download the ics and create the "adapted" ICs for the test:
> ./getIC.sh
> python adaptIC.py

2) Create the first swift executable for the hydro run:
> ./configure --disable-hand-vec --with-hydro=sphenix --with-kernel=cubic-spline

3) Run it
> ./swift --hydro --threads=4 -n 16 density_test_Hydro.yml

4) Create the second swift executable for the sidm run:
> ./configure --with-sidm=yes

5) Run it
> ./swift --sidm -G --threads=4 -n 16 density_test_DM.yml

6) Compare outputs
> python plot_solution.py
