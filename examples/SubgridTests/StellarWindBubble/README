# Intro
This example consists of a homogeneous and periodic box filled with gas particles of equal mass. An individual star particle may be added after some time to first let the system rearrange.

This example tests the bubble propagation for different injection of stellar winds. 

# Configure
To run this example with the GEAR model,

```
CFLAGS="-DSWIFT_TEST_STELLAR_WIND" ./configure  --with-chemistry=GEAR_10 --with-cooling=grackle_0 --with-stars=GEAR --with-star-formation=GEAR --with-sink=GEAR --with-feedback=GEAR --with-kernel=wendland-C2
```

Then, type

```
make -j
```

# ICs
The run.sh script calls the `makeIC.py' script with default values. You can experiment by changing the ICs. Run `python3 makeIC.py --help` to get the list of parameters.

# run 
To run the script, once you've changed the parameter you wanted, you can simply make a sbatch or srun on the `run.sh` script. It will automatically create a folder containing the IC and the simulation. Then, the script will call the `gas_profile_movie.py` that makes a gif of the bubble's quantities over time and log some parameters' information in a .txt file `radial_peak_position.txt`. Finally, the `bubble_evolution.py` will use the information in the .txt file to plot the evolution of the bubble alongside with some theoretical formulas.
(Exemple: ./run.sh)
