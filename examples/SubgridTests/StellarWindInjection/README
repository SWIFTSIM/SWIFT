# Intro
This example consists of a homogeneous and periodic box filled with gas particles of equal mass. An individual star particle may be added after some time to first let the system rearrange.

This example tests energy ejected by the stellar winds with no external influence. Compared to Feedback_IC_box this one has a cartesian grid !

# Configure
To run this example with the GEAR model,

```
CFLAGS="-DSWIFT_TEST_STELLAR_WIND" ./configure  --with-chemistry=GEAR_10 --with-stars=GEAR --with-star-formation=GEAR --with-sink=GEAR --with-feedback=GEAR --with-kernel=wendland-C2
```

Then, type

```
make -j
```

You can remove the adaptive softening. In this case, you may need to change the default `max_physical_baryon_softening` value.

# ICs
The start.slurm script calls the `makeIC.py' script with default values. You can experiment by changing the ICs. Run `python3 makeIC.py --help` to get the list of parameters.

# run 
To run the script, once you've changed the parameter you wanted, you can simply make a sbatch or srun. It will automatically create a folder containing the IC and the simulation as well as a `verification.txt`. This file tells you if it detected an error in the interpolation made inside swift.
(Exemple: ./run.sh)

If you want to launch multiple simulations in parallel you can use the script `run_multiple.sh` after having modified the parameters you want. 
(Exempl: ./run_multiple.sh)

The `verification.py` script can be used directly on all your folder (to avoid going through many directories to search for errors) !
(Example: python3 verification.py -v test_*/output.log | tee verification.txt)
