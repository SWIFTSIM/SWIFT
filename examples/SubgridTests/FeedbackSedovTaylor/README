# Intro
This example consists of a homogeneous and periodic box filled with gas particles of equal mass. An individual star particle lies at the center.

This example tests the Taylor-Sedov blastwave for different feedback implementations. It also serves for convergence testing.

# Configure
To run this example with the GEAR model,

```
./configure --disable-mpi --with-chemistry=GEAR_10 --with-cooling=grackle_0 --with-stars=GEAR --with-star-formation=GEAR --with-feedback=X --with-kernel=wendland-C2 --with-adaptive-softening --with-grackle=path/to/grackle
```

where X can be:
- GEAR : GEAR thermal feedback,
- GEAR-mechanical_1 : GEAR mechanical feedback mode 1, Fire-2-like implementation,
- GEAR-mechanical_2 : GEAR mechanical feedback mode 2, Fire-3-like implementation.

Then, type

```
make -j
```

You can remove the adaptive softening. In this case, you may need to change the default `max_physical_baryon_softening` value.

# ICs
The run.sh script calls the `makeIC.py' script with default values. You can experiment by changing the ICs. Run `python3 makeIC.py --help` to get the list of parameters.

# Run
Type run.sh, and let's go!

# Multiple runs (TODO)
To perform many runs to get statistics for the isotropy, you can use:

```
run_name="GEAR_MECH1" n_runs=100 ./run_multiple.sh
```
