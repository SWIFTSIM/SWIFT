# Intro
This example consists of a homogeneous and periodic box filled with gas particles of equal mass. 100 individual star particle are distributed randomlt in the box. They will go into supernova one after the other, starting at ~ 7 Myr and separated by 1 Myr.

This examples tests the momentum conservation after the explosion of each supernova.

# Configure
To run this example with the GEAR model,

```
./configure --disable-mpi --with-chemistry=GEAR_10 --with-feedback=X --with-cooling=grackle_0 --with-stars=GEAR --with-star-formation=GEAR --with-kernel=wendland-C2 --with-grackle=$GRACKLE_ROOT --with-equation-of-state=isothermal-gas --with-hydro=gizmo-mfm --with-riemann-solver=hllc
```

where X can be:
- GEAR : GEAR thermal feedback,
- GEAR-mechanical_1 : GEAR mechanical feedback mode 1, Fire-2-like implementation,
- GEAR-mechanical_2 : GEAR mechanical feedback mode 2, Fire-3-like implementation.

Then, type

```
make -j
```

# ICs
The run.sh script calls the `makeIC.py' script with default values. You can experiment by changing the ICs. Run `python3 makeIC.py --help` to get the list of parameters.

# Run
Type run.sh, and let's go!
