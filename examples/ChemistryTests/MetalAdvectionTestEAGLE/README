Metal advection test for the EAGLE chemistry scheme

In some schemes, like the meshless (gizmo) scheme, particles exchange 
masses via fluxes. This example tests whether the metals are correctly
advected with those mass fluxes (for the EAGLE chemistry scheme)

To run this test, compile with:
    --with-hydro-dimension=2 --with-hydro=gizmo-mfv --with-riemann-solver=hllc --with-chemistry=EAGLE
