# Intro
This example is a non cosmological homogeneous box with gas only.

TODO

# Configure
To run this example with GEAR model,

'''
./configure --disable-mpi --with-chemistry=GEAR_10 --with-cooling=grackle_0 --with-stars=GEAR --with-star-formation=GEAR --with-feedback=GEAR --with-kernel=wendland-C2 --with-grackle=path/to/grackle

and then

make -j

You can remove the adaptive softening. In this case, you may need to change the default `max_physical_baryon_softening` value.

Other sink models can be probed by changing swift configuration and adding the relevant parameters in params.yml.

# ICs
The run.sh script calls `makeIC.py' script with default values. You can experiment by changing the ICs. Run `python3 makeIC.py --help` to get the list of parameters.

# Run
Type run.sh, and let's go!

# Changing the cooling
You can change grackle mode to 1,2, or 3 if you want. You may also want to change the simulation end time.

For grackle_0 (equilibrium mode), the first sink form roughly at 0.260 (internal units). The end time is 0.282 Myr. The simulation runs in ~ 2 minutes.

Notice that, for grackle_X with X from 1 to 3, the level 5 simulation does not have enough particles to run for long times. At 0.5 Gyr, swift ends because there are not enough particles per top-level cell. However, note how different the collapse from grackle_0 is!
