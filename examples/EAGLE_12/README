ICs extracted from the EAGLE suite of simulations. 

WARNING: The ICs are 460MB in size. They contain ~6.5M DM particles,
~6M gas particles and ~250k star particles.

The particle distribution here is the snapshot 27 (z=0.1) of the 12Mpc
Ref-model. h- and a- factors from the original Gadget code have been
corrected for. Variables not used in a pure hydro & gravity code have
been removed.  Everything is ready to be run without cosmological
integration.

The particle load of the main EAGLE simulation can be reproduced by
running these ICs on 8 cores.

MD5 checksum of the ICs:
