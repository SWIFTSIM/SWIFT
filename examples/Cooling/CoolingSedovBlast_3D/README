Realistic SNe Sedov-Taylor explosion (realistic in the sense that it uses the
right order of magnitude for all variables). Meant to be run with const Lambda
cooling, but should also work with other cooling (the workflow also obtains
the EAGLE cooling tables).

The included Makefile (run.make) contains the full workflow that runs the
simulation and creates a plot of the energy evolution, the evolution of the
shock radius and velocity, and a movie of the density, velocity and temperature
profile.

To run the test, use
  make -f run.make
this will run the simulation in a subdirectory called "run".

To run in a different subdirectory (useful for comparisons), use
  make -f run.make folder=my_subdirectory_name

The energy and shock evolution scripts (plot_energy.py and plot_time_profile.py)
can also be run in comparison mode:
  python3 plot_energy.py \
    subdirectory1/statistics.txt subdirectory1/statistics.txt \
    energy_1_vs_2.png \
    --names "Run 1" "Run 2"
and
  python3 plot_time_evolution.py \
    subdirectory1/profile.txt subdirectory1/profile.txt \
    time_evolution_1_vs_2.png \
    --names "Run 1" "Run 2"
(there is not limit on the number of runs that can be included).
