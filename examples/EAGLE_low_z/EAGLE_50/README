ICs extracted from the EAGLE suite of simulations. 

WARNING: The ICs are 28GB in size. They contain ~425M DM particles,
~405M gas particles and ~20M star particles

The particle distribution here is the snapshot 27 (z=0.1) of the 50Mpc
Ref-model. h- and a- factors from the original Gadget code have been
corrected for. Variables not used in a pure hydro & gravity code have
been removed. 
Everything is ready to be run without cosmological integration. 

The particle load of the main EAGLE simulation can be reproduced by
running these ICs on 512 cores.

MD5 checksum of the ICs:
