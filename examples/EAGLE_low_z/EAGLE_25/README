ICs extracted from the EAGLE suite of simulations. 

WARNING: The ICs are 3.6GB in size. They contain ~52M DM particles,
~50M gas particles and ~2M star particles.

The particle distribution here is the snapshot 27 (z=0.1) of the 25Mpc
Ref-model. h- and a- factors from the original Gadget code have been
corrected for. Variables not used in a pure hydro & gravity code have
been removed. 
Everything is ready to be run without cosmological integration. 

The particle load of the main EAGLE simulation can be reproduced by
running these ICs on 64 cores.

MD5 checksum of the ICs:

A second example is set up to run with `./run_rt_test.sh`. It makes use
of the `eagle_25_rt_test.yml` file, and is intended to stress-test the
RT implementation rather than produce actual physically meaningful results.


o   To use GEAR-RT, configure SWIFT with

    --with-stars=basic --with-hydro=gizmo-mfv --with-riemann-solver=hllc --with-rt=GEAR_1 --with-rt-riemann-solver=GLF --with-feedback=none

[technically, any other feedback scheme should work as well.]
[the .yml file is set up to handle up to 3 photon groups, so
 you could also be compiling with --with-rt=GEAR_3 if you want
 to test more photon groups as well.]


o   To use the DEBUG RT scheme, configure SWIFT with
 --with-stars=basic --with-rt=debug --with-feedback=none

[technically, any other feedback scheme should work as well.]
