ICs extracted from the EAGLE suite of simulations. 

WARNING: These ICs correspond to a very small cosmological volume
and are not representative of actual load-balancing of large runs.

The particle distribution here is the snapshot 27 (z=0.1) of the 6.25Mpc
Ref-model. h- and a- factors from the original Gadget code have been
corrected for. Variables not used in a pure hydro & gravity code have
been removed. 
Everything is ready to be run without cosmological integration.
