ICs extracted from the EAGLE suite of simulations. 

WARNING: The ICs are 460MB in size. They contain ~6.5M DM particles,
~6M gas particles and ~250k star particles.

The particle distribution here is the snapshot 27 (z=0.1) of the 12Mpc
Ref-model. h- and a- factors from the original Gadget code have been
corrected for. Variables not used in a pure hydro & gravity code have
been removed.  Everything is ready to be run without cosmological
integration.

The particle load of the main EAGLE simulation can be reproduced by
running these ICs on 8 cores.

A second example is set up to run with `./run_rt_test.sh`. It makes use
of the `eagle_12_rt_test.yml` file, and is intended to stress-test the
RT implementation rather than produce actual physically meaningful results.


o   To use GEAR-RT, configure SWIFT with

    --with-stars=basic --with-hydro=gizmo-mfv --with-riemann-solver=hllc --with-rt=GEAR_1 --with-rt-riemann-solver=GLF --with-feedback=none

[technically, any other feedback scheme should work as well.]
[the .yml file is set up to handle up to 3 photon groups, so
 you could also be compiling with --with-rt=GEAR_3 if you want
 to test more photon groups as well.]


o   To use the DEBUG RT scheme, configure SWIFT with
 --with-stars=basic --with-rt=debug --with-feedback=none

[technically, any other feedback scheme should work as well.]
