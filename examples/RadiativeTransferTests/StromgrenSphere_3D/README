Str√∂mgen Sphere example in 3D

For now, there are no gas interactions, and we use this
example to perform tests and checks on photon injection
and their propagation. The example contains 1 star in a
glass hydro distribution in 3D. (State 09/2021)

Intented to compile with :
    --with-rt=GEAR_1 --with-hydro-dimension=3

Scripts in this directory:

    - plotRadiationProjection.py:
        plot photon energies and fluxes as a 2D projected 
        image

    - plotPhotonPropagationCheck.py:
        Plots radiation energies and fluxes as function of 
        radius centered on the injecting star. 
        NOTE: Make sure that you use a photon group that 
        doesn't interact with the gas to check the 
        propagation properly. You'll have to hard-code
        the index of the photon group in the script itself.
