This test case contains only gas and stars in a periodic box. The contents have
no physical meaning, and are background particles on a regular grid overlapping
a randomly sampled sine wave particle distribution. The purposes of this test are
as follows:

- Neither the stars nor the gas particles are updated all at the same time. 
  This test has commonly particles being updated at their individual time step.
- The stars always have neighbours, so that's one less thing to thing about when
  testing your schemes.
- Contrary to ../UniformBox_3D, the test runs on gadgetoid cosmological internal
  units, not on cgs.

You can and should run the same sanity check scripts as in ../UniformBox_3D to
check that everything's right.
