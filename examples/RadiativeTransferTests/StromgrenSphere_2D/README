Strömgen Sphere example in 2D
-----------------------------

This directory contains two examples in one:

    -   run a Strömgren sphere example, where a single central
        star ionizes the surrounding medium in a 2D plane.
        To run this example, use the provided `run.sh` script.
        This script will then make use of the `makeIC.py` and
        `plotSolution.py` script.

    -   run a propagation test of photons emitted from a single 
        central source in an otherwise uniform 2D plane.
        To run this example, use the provided `runPropagationTest.sh` script.
        This script will then make use of the `makePropagationTestIC.py` and
        `plotPhotonPropagationCheck.py` script.

Additional scripts:
    -   `plotRadiationProjection.py`: Plots a projection of the radiation
        quantities (energies, fluxes). NOTE: you might need to change the
        'snapshot_base' variable at the top of the script depending on which
        solutions you want to plot.

To use the GEAR RT model, compile with :
    --with-rt=GEAR_1 --with-rt-riemann-solver=GLF --with-hydro-dimension=2 --with-hydro=gizmo-mfv --with-riemann-solver=hllc --with-stars=GEAR --with-feedback=none --with-grackle=$GRACKLE_ROOT

To use the SPHM1 RT model, compile with :
    --with-rt=SPHM1RT_4 --with-hydro-dimension=2  --with-stars=basic --with-feedback=none   --with-sundials=$SUNDIALS_ROOT
    
IMPORTANT: Need SUNDIALS version  = 5 . 
SUNDIALS_ROOT is the root directory that contains the lib and include directories, e.g. on cosma:
SUNDIALS_ROOT=/cosma/local/sundials/5.1.0/
