Str√∂mgen Sphere example in 3D
-----------------------------

This directory contains the following example:
    -   run a propagation test of photons emitted from a single 
        central source in an otherwise uniform box.
        To run this example, use the provided `runPropagationTest.sh` script.
        This script will then make use of the `makePropagationTestIC.py` and
        `plotPhotonPropagationCheck.py` script.


Additional scripts:
    -   `plotRadiationProjection.py`: Plots a projection of the radiation
        quantities (energies, fluxes). NOTE: you might need to change the
        'snapshot_base' variable at the top of the script depending on which
        solutions you want to plot.
             

To use the GEAR RT model, compile with :
    --with-rt=GEAR_1 --with-rt-riemann-solver=GLF --with-hydro=gizmo-mfv --with-riemann-solver=hllc --with-stars=GEAR --with-feedback=none --with-grackle=$GRACKLE_ROOT
