Str√∂mgen Sphere example in 3D
-----------------------------

This directory contains the following example:
    -   run a propagation test of photons emitted from a single 
        central source in an otherwise uniform box.
        To run this example, use the provided `runPropagationTest.sh` script.
        This script will then make use of the `makePropagationTestIC.py` and
        `plotPhotonPropagationCheck.py` script.


Additional scripts:
    -   `plotRadiationProjection.py`: Plots a projection of the radiation
        quantities (energies, fluxes). NOTE: you might need to change the
        'snapshot_base' variable at the top of the script depending on which
        solutions you want to plot.
             

To use the GEAR RT model, compile with :
    --with-rt=GEAR_1 --with-rt-riemann-solver=GLF --with-hydro=gizmo-mfv --with-riemann-solver=hllc --with-stars=GEAR --with-feedback=none --with-grackle=$GRACKLE_ROOT

Note that the tests which have reference solutions can't be reproduced by the
GEAR RT scheme as-is, because they require the gas density to be fixed throughout
the entire run. This can't be done for Gizmo-MFV hydrodynamics as easily as for
other SPH schemes, where fixing the particle positions suffices to keep the density
constant. If you want to fix the particle densities nonetheless, please consult the
instructions provided in
