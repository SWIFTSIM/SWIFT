#   ./rt_sanity_checks-GEAR.py snapshot_basename
#
# where 'snapshot_basename' is the base name of the snapshots that you

                # energy overshoots should decrease in magnitude, so the curves should converge towards
                # zero. Lastly, float precision summation roundoff errors can add deviations in the order
                # of 10^-3. So you should see:
                #   - decreasing magnitude of curves
                #   - values are negative, save for roundoff errors
