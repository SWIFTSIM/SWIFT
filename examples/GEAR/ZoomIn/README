Initial conditions for a zoom in cosmological simulation of dwarf
galaxies. These have been generated by MUSIC and ran up to z=0 with
GEAR (see Revaz and Jablonka 2018 for more details on the simulation).

The cosmology is taken from Planck 2015.

The initial conditions have been cleaned to contain only the required
fields. The ICs have been created for Gadget and the positions and box
size are hence expressed in h-full units (e.g. box size of 3.4 / h Mpc).
Similarly, the peculiar velocitites contain an extra sqrt(a) factor. 

We will use SWIFT to cancel the h- and a-factors from the ICs.

MD5 check-sum of the ICS:
