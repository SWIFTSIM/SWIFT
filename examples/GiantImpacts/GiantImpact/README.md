An example planetary simulation of a giant impact onto the young Uranus with 
~10^6 SPH particles, as described in Kegerreis et al. (2018), ApJ, 861, 52.

This example requires the code to be configured to use the Planetary
hydrodynamics and equation of state:
 --with-hydro=planetary --with-equation-of-state=planetary
