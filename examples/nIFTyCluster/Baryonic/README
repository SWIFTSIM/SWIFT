Initial conditions
------------------

These initial conditions are reproduced, with permission, from
the original authors. The initial conditions here contain
baryons, and are the ones that were used in
https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016MNRAS.457.4063S/abstract.

We have modified these initial conditions (initially Gadget binary)
to work with SWIFT, which only accepts HDF5. There are scripts
in this folder that download the required python modules and
create the initial conditions from the Gadget style ones, should
you have them available. Alternatively you can download the
initial conditions from our webstorage with the getIC.sh script.


About the simulation
--------------------

This is a very deep zoom, with 4 levels of hierarchy. You should
run SWIFT in multi-softening mode to complete this in reasonable time.
Usually we would expect this to run in about a day on a single Skylake
HPC node.

Some boilerplate for running on a SLURM batch system is included in
the `run.sh` script.

Running structure finders
-------------------------

We recommend running velociraptor with the following compilation
options:

```
cmake .. -DVR_USE_GAS=ON -DVR_USE_HYDRO=OFF -DVR_ZOOM_SIM=ON
         -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-O3 -march=native"
```
