Small LCDM cosmological simulation generated by C. Power. Cosmology
is WMAP9 and the box is 100Mpc/h in size with 64^3 particles.
We use a softening length of 1/25th of the mean inter-particle separation.

The ICs have been generated to run with Gadget-2 so we need to switch
on the options to cancel the h-factors and a-factors at reading time.

MD5 checksum of the ICs:

# How to run with CSDS

To enable the CSDS, add --enable-csds --enable-python when
configuring swift.

In `run_csds.sh`, update `velociraptor_path` to the location
of velociraptor on your system. Then, use `./run_csds.sh` and
let's go!
