We show here how to run such initial conditions with the GEAR model.

To generate the initial conditions locally, if pNbody is installed, run:

../makeDisk.py

If you don't have access to pNbody, you can simply skip this step. The initial conditions will automatically 
be downloaded when launching the run script (see below).


To run this example with the GEAR model, SWIFT must be configured with the following options:

./configure --with-chemistry=GEAR_10  --with-cooling=grackle_0 --with-pressure-floor=GEAR  --with-stars=GEAR --with-star-formation=GEAR --with-feedback=GEAR --with-grackle=${GRACKLE_ROOT}

To start the simulation with the GEAR model:

./run.sh
