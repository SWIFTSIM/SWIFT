These examples show how to run Swift on initial conditions of a multi-component 
isolated galactic disk generated with the pNbody code (http://lastro.epfl.ch/projects/pNbody/).

In the current example, the galactic disk is composed of an exponential disk, a Plummer bulge,
a Miyamoto-Nagai gaseous disk all three embedded in an NFW halo.
The systems is put at equilibrium by solving the Jeans equations.
