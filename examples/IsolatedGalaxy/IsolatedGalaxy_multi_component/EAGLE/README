We show here how to run such initial conditions with the EAGLE model.

To generate the initial conditions locally, if pNbody is installed, run:

../makeDisk.py

If you don't have access to pNbody, you can simply skip this step. The initial conditions will automatically 
be downloaded when launching the run script (see below).

To run this example with the EAGLE model, SWIFT must be configured with the following options:

./configure --with-chemistry=EAGLE  --with-cooling=EAGLE  --with-stars=EAGLE --with-star-formation=EAGLE --with-feedback=EAGLE --with-tracers=EAGLE

To start the simulation with the EAGLE model:

./run.sh
