This directory contains initial conditions generated for
the EAGLE suite of simulations. The cosmology, resolution
and phases are the same as used in the original suite. The only
difference is the file format, adapted for SWIFT.

For standard runs, the code should be configured with

--with-subgrid=EAGLE-XL --with-hydro=sphenix --with-kernel=wendland-C2

(and any other optimization, library or compiler parameters specific
to your system.)

Compared to the original EAGLE runs of Schaye et al. 2015),
the following changes have been made (at standard resolution):

 - The flavour of SPH has been changed from the Pressure-Entropy
   "ANARCHY" implementation to the Density-energy based "SPHENIX"
   implementation of Borrow+20.
 - The dark matter softening lengths have been increased to 1.3
   pkpc and 3.32 ckpc. The comoving baryon softening lengths have
   been changed to 1.79 ckpc. This follows the recommendations of
   Ludlow et al. 2019. Old values were 0.7 pkpc and 2.69 ckpc for
   all the particle species.
 - SPH particles reaching a mass larger than 7*10^6 Msun (~4x the
   initial gas particle mass) are now split into 2 equal mass
   particles within the smoothing length of the original particle.
 - The metallicity-dependent density threshold for star formation
   uses the smoothed metallicities and not the raw metallicities
   any more.
 - The cooling uses the Ploeckinger+20 tables including an updated
   UV background, newer version of CLOUDY and self-shielding
   (was using the Wiersma+09 tables before).
 - The redshift of H reionization has been lowered to 7.5 (from 11.5).
 - The entropy floor between n_H = 10^-5 and 10^-1 cm^3 at 8000K has
   been removed as the new cooling tables handle this correctly. The
   gamma=4/3 floor has been extended to lower densities
   (i.e. 800K at n_H = 10^-4 cm^-3) as a fail-safe.
 - Particles can be star-forming if they are within 0.3 dex of the
   entropy floor (was 0.5 dex). These particles also get their
   subgrid properties (rho, T as well as the HI and H_2 frac) computed.
 - Particles can be star-forming if they are in an over-density of
   at least 100 (was 57.7).
 - The minimal mass of SNII stars has been raised to 8 Msun (from 6).
 - The SNII feedback delay is done by sampling the stellar age
   distribution and not using a fixed delay of 30 Myr any more.
 - The energy range for the SNII variable f_th is now 0.5 - 5.0
   (from 0.3 - 3.0).
 - The density and metallicity used for the f_th scaling of the
   SNII feedback are now computed at the time of feedback from the
   gas neighbours and are not the birth quantities any more.
 - The halo mass for BH seeding has been lowered to 10^10 M_sun
   (from 10^10/h Msun).
 - The BH seed mass (subgrid mass at birth) has been lowered to
   10^4 Msun (from 10^5/h Msun).
 - The black hole accretion rate is now limited to 100% of the
   Eddington rate (from 100/h = 150 %).
 - The circular velocity threshold for BH mergers is measured
   at the actual distance linking the BHs not at the kernel support
   length any more.
 - The BHs can reposition only onto gas particles and not onto any
   type as before.
 - The maximal relative velocity between a BH and gas particle
   eligible to be a reposition target has been increased to 0.5 times
   the local sound-speed around the BH (was 0.25 * c_sound).
 - No limit is imposed any more on the velocity (w.r.t. the BH)
   of the gas particles onto which the BHs can reposition.
 - BHs of all masses can be repositioned (was limited to
   M_BH < 1.8*10^8 Msun).
 - BHs do not swallow gas particles any more. They nibble small
   amounts of mass from the eligible neighbours within their kernel.
 - Gas particles can be nibbled down to 50% of their initial mass.
 - The angular momentum term in the BH accretion model of
   Rosas-Guevara et al. (2015) is now switched off.
 - The coupling efficency of the BH feedback is now 0.1 (was 0.15).


The scripts in this directory download the tables required to
run the EAGLE model. Plotting scripts are also provided
for basic quantities.

To use the cooling model based on the Wiersma+09 tables, replace
EAGLE-XL by EAGLE in the configuration command line.

VELOCIraptor can be run on the output. The code is compiled
using

cmake -DVR_USE_GAS=ON -DVR_USE_STAR=ON -DV_USE_BH=ON

and run using

stf -C vrconfig_3dfof_subhalos_SO_hydro.cfg -i eagle_0036 -o halos_0036 -I 2
