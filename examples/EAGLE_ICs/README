This directory contains initial conditions generated for
the EAGLE suite of simulations. The cosmology, resolution
and phases are the same as used in the original suite. The only
difference is the file format, adapted for SWIFT.

The scripts in this directory download the tables required to
run the EAGLE model. Plotting scripts are also provided
for basic quantities.
