These examples show how to run Swift on initial conditions of a two-component (gravity-only)
dwarf model generated with the pNbody code (http://lastro.epfl.ch/projects/pNbody/).

In the current example, the dwarf galaxy is composed of a Plummer spheroid 
embedded in a cuspy or cored halo.
The systems is put at equilibrium by sampling a distribution function obtained from the Eddington equation.
