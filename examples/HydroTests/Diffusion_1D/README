Diffusion 1D
============

This is a very simple, 1D test. It sets up a uniform density particle
distribution, with energy discontinuities generated at every particle.
Particles have their internal energy set in a binary manner, with them
alternating between "low" and "high" states. Under a standard SPH
scheme, we expect to see no evolution whatsoever in the box. However,
under a scheme with thermal diffusion, we expect that there will be
some diffusion between the particles and that the distribution of
internal energy will equalise.

Included are some scripts to create initial conditions (`makeIC.py`),
plot a solution (`plotSolution.py`), and to run the code (`run.sh`).
Also included is a script to run a convergence test by changing the
`SPH:beta_diffusion` parameter (`run_set.sh`).

To make the initial conditions and produce the plots, the `swiftsimio`
library (http://gitlab.cosma.dur.ac.uk/jborrow/swiftsimio) is required.
