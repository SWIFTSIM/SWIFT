Balsara & Kim Supernova Driven Turbulence
_________________________________________

This example is based on the supernova-driven turbulence test from Balsara & Kim (2004) and Price (2018), only without MHD.

It consists of a series of energy injections at pre-determined times and locations, artificially simulating supernova energy injections. These injections will form interacting shock shells driving turbulence (and magnetic field amplification), and in turn result in a filamentary structure.

Note: the test takes quite some time to run due to the imposed timestepping procedure

Running the test
________________

configure swift as:
./configure --with-forcing=balsarakim --with-cooling=EAGLE --with-chemistry=EAGLE --with-kernel=quintic-spline --disable-hand-vec

Get the glass IC file: 
wget https://virgodb.cosma.dur.ac.uk/swift-webstorage/ICs/glassCube_64.hdf5

Adjust the ICs:
python3 makeIC.py

Get the EAGLE cooling tables:
wget https://virgodb.cosma.dur.ac.uk/swift-webstorage/CoolingTables/EAGLE/coolingtables.tar.gz
tar -xvzf coolingtables.tar.gz

And run the simulation
../../../swift --hydro --cooling balsarakim.yml |& tee output.log

You can also set up the test by running:
./run.sh


Analysing the Snapshots

To analyse the snapshots you can run the following

python3 PlotResult.py

Adjustments & Variations
________________________

There are some adjustments/variations possible.

1. changing the energy injection times/locations
the injection_coords.txt file consists of four columns. The first specifies the time of the injection in Myr. The second to fourth respectively specify the x,y,z coordinates relative to the boxsize.

2. changing the mode of energy injection
There are multiple possible ways of injecting energy you can specify in the parameter file
    1) set the internal energy to a density dependent value (default)
    2) set the internal energy to a constant given value
    3) set the velocity of particles (radially) to a density dependent value
    4) set the velocity of particles (radially) to a constant given value

3. changing the cooling scheme
The example uses the EAGLE cooling scheme and chemistry which, although the chemistry does not evolve, allows for a (metallicity and) temparature dependent cooling coefficient. In principle other cooling schemes are also possible. Note that we explicitely run without an entropy floor to capture the fragmentation and filamentary resulting structure.
