Square Test
-----------

This is a very challenging test that aims to figure out
if contact discontinuities are properly handled. If there
is residual surface tension, then the square will quickly
become a sphere. Otherwise, it will remain a square. For
more information see Hopkins' 2013 and 2015 papers.

There are two initial condition generation files present.
For the SWIFT method of finding an un-mass weighted number
of particles in the kernel, it makes more sense to have
different mass particles (makeICDifferentMasses.py). For
comparison to previous methods, we also provide a script
that creates initial conditions with a different density
of particles, all with equal masses, in the square and
outside of the square.

If you do not have the swiftsimio library, you can use
the plotSolutionLegacy.py to plot the solution.
