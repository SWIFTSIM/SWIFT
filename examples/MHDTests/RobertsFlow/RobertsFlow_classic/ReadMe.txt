This is the RobertsFlow test case
There are 5 types of flows: One from Axel's paper, 4 from original Roberts paper
Note: in Roberts paper the rms velocity is different from V0, so magnetic Reynolds number might not be just Rm = V0*L/eta


In each flow ICs are generated by makeIC_flow#.py
the arguments are: 
 1) V0
 2) eta
 3) fullpath to glassFile or FCC (glass files will be stored in ICFiles folder)
 4) kv - wavenumber of the velocity field
 5) kb - wavenumber of the initial B field
the script generates inital .hdf5 file and modifies RobertsFlow.yml with selected parameters, gives an output.yml. This .yml is the config to run the simulation

These ICs follow the original G.O.Roberts 1972 paper*:
"Dynamo action of Fluid Motions with Two-Dimenstional Periodicity"

*) apart from initial B field. But this does not matter because dynamos forget initial field configuration
