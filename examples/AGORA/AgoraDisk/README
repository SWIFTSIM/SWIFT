To run this example, SWIFT must be configured with the following options:

./configure --with-subgrid=AGORA

or similarily 

./configure --with-feedback=AGORA --with-chemistry=AGORA  --with-cooling=grackle_0  --with-pressure-floor=GEAR --with-stars=GEAR --with-star-formation=GEAR 


An analysis script for this test case can be found in the AGORA project repository:
https://bitbucket.org/mornkr/agora-analysis-script/

A modified version of the script able to read in SWIFT data is available upon request.

(Note to the SWIFT authors: The modified script is stored with the other reference solutions.)
