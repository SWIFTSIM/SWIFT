SWIFT Documentation
===================

This is the main documentation for SWIFT that can be found on ReadTheDocs
or at `swiftsim.com/docs`.

You will need the `sphinx` and `sphinx-autobuild` python packages (pip install
them!) to build the documentation to html, as well as the `sphinx_rtd_theme`
package which is used as the theme.

To build the documentation (from this directory), `make html` and the output
files will be created in `build/html/`.

Please consider adding documentation when you add code!
