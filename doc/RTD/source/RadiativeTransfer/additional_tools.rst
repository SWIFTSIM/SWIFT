Additional Tools
-------------------

A plethora of additional RT related tools is hosted in the 
`the swiftsim-rt-tools <https://github.com/SWIFTSIM/swiftsim-rt-tools>`_
repository. For example, it contains tools to convert injected photon number 
rates into luminosities, compute integrated interaction cross sections for 
various spectra, some rudimentary thermochemistry python functions, etc.
