SWIFT is an open-source cosmological and astrophysical numerical
solver designed to run efficiently on modern hardware. A comprehensive
and extensive set of models for galaxy formation as well as planetary
physics are provided alongside a large series of examples.

This users' and developers' documentation is best enjoyed with a glass
of Amarone and Rachmaninoff's second piano concerto in the
background. We note that good results have also been reported using a
tumbler of 16yrs old Lagavulin.
