Below we give an example of parameter choices applicable for e.g. a 50 Mpc box. The new parameters are from ``include_jets`` and below. Their descriptions are given next to the parameters.

        accretion_efficiency:               1.         # The accretion efficiency (suppression factor of the accretion rate) to use in the thick disc (ADAF), to represent the effects of subgrid winds that take away most of the mass flowing through the accretion disc.

        include_GRMHD_spindown:             1          # Whether to include high jet spindown rates from GRMHD simulations [1], or use an analytical formula that assumes extraction of energy from the rotational mass/energy of the BH.
        include_ADIOS_suppression:          0          # Whether to suppress the accretion rate in the fully thick disc regime [1] (Eddington rate below 0.2alpha^2) by the amount expected to be taken away by isotropic kinetic disk winds.
        turn_off_secondary_feedback:        1          # If set to 1, there will be only radiative (thermal) feedback in the thin disk mode, and only jets in the thick disk mode.
        jet_h_r_slope:                      1.         # The slope of the dependence of jet efficiency on aspect ratio of the subgrid accretion disk, H/R. Default value is 1, and another reasonable value is 0 (same jet efficiency for all disks). Reality could be anything in between. This parameter is only used if turn_off_secondary_feedback is set to 0.
        delta_ADAF:                         0.2        # Electron heating parameter, which controls the strength of radiative feedback in thick disks. Should be between 0.1 and 0.5. This parameter is only used if turn_off_secondary_feedback is set to 0.
        include_slim_disk:                  1          # Global switch whether to include super-Eddington accretion, modeled as the slim disk. If set to 0, disks will be considered thin even at very large accretion rates.

Most of these parameters should work well generally, and should not be changed except for tests. We will discuss only some of the more important ones. You can choose whether to have only the thick and thin disk (low and high BH accretion rates, respectively), or you can also include the slim disk at super-Eddington rates with ``include_slim_disk``. You can control what type of feedback you (do not) want with ``include_jets`` and ``turn_off_radiative_feedback``. If you choose to turn off jets, everything will be modeled as a thin disk (regardless of accretion rate), since jets go hand-in-hand with the thick and the slim disk. Similarly, if you turn off radiation, everything will be treated as a thick disk.

If you set ``use_var_v_jet:   0``, you will need to change ``v_jet``, the kicking velocity of particles, depending on what system you are simulating. You should typically choose values at least 10 times larger than the sound speed of the hot gas in your most massive haloes (e.g. 1500 km/s for a MW-type galaxy and 10 000 km/s for a :math:`10^{14}` :math:`\mathrm{M}_\odot` halo). If, on the other hand, you set ``use_var_v_jet:   1``, the launching velocities will vary on their own depending on the typical sound speed (virial velocity) of the hot gas in the haloes. You then need to set ``v_jet_cs_ratio`` to values :math:`\gg1` (10-30 works well) in order to have significant shocking.
