.. _SIDM:

Self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) implementation
=======================
.. warning::
    The SIDM scheme is still in development and is not useable
    at this moment. This page is currently a placeholder to document new
    features and requirements as the code grows.

SIDM is implemented as a separate particle species using ``PartType7`` (i.e. the code does not consider ``PartType1`` particles as being of SIDM nature).
