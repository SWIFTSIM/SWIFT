We implement the method of Price & Monaghan (2007). This add correction terms to
the SPH equations of motions to account for the change in energy and momentum
created by the change in gravitationl potential generated by the change of
softening.  The softening length is tied to the gas' smoothing length and is
thus adapting with the changes in density field.  To use adaptive softening, use
	     
.. code-block:: bash

    ./configure --with-adaptive-softening=yes

The adaptive softening scheme is implemented for all the SPH schemes above but
only for the Wendland-C2 kernel as it is the kernel used for the gravity
softening throughout the code.
