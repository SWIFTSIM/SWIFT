Planetary Hydro Scheme
======================

This scheme is based on :ref:`minimal` but also allows multiple materials,
meaning that different SPH particles can be assigned different
`equations of state <equations_of_state.html>`_ (EoS).
Every SPH particle then requires and carries the additional ``MaterialID`` flag
from the initial conditions file. This flag indicates the particle's material
and which EoS it should use.

The Balsara viscosity switch is used by default, but can be disabled by
compiling SWIFT with ``make CFLAGS=-DPLANETARY_SPH_NO_BALSARA``.

Note: the boundary-improvement methods presented in Ruiz-Bonilla+2022 are
in the process of being improved for release with better documentation etc soon.
