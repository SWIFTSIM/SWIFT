Getting Started
===============

So, you want to use SWIFT? Below you should find all of the information you need
to get up and running with some examples, and then build your own initial conditions
for running.

Also, you might want to consult our onboarding guide (available at
https://swift.strw.leidenuniv.nl/onboarding.pdf) if you would like something to print out
and keep on your desk.
