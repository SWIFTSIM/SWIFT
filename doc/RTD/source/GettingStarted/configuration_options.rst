Configuration Options
=====================

There are many configuration options that SWIFT makes available; a few key
ones are summarised here.

Note that these need to be ran with ``./configure x`` where ``x`` is the
configuration flag.

A description of the available options of the below flags can be found by using
``./configure  --help``.

``--with-hydro=sphenix``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are several hydrodynamical schemes available in SWIFT. You can choose
between them at compile-time with this option.

``--with-riemann-solver=none``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Some hydrodynamical schemes, for example GIZMO, require a Riemann solver.

``--with-kernel=cubic-spline``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Several kernels are made available for use with the hydrodynamical schemes.
Choose between them with this compile-time flag.

``--with-hydro-dimension=3``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Run problems in 1, 2, and 3 (default) dimensions.

``--with-equation-of-state=ideal-gas``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Several equations of state are made available with this flag. Also consider
``--with-adiabatic-index``.

``--with-cooling=none``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Several cooling implementations (including GRACKLE) are available.

``--with-ext-potential=none``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Many external potentials are available for use with SWIFT. You can choose
between them at compile time. Some examples include a central potential, a
softened central potential, and a sinusoidal potential. You will need to
configure, for example, the mass in your parameter file at runtime.
