What SWIFT can do
=================

SWIFT can solve a variety of problems aimed at cosmological and
astrophysical applications. SWIFT's features include:

+ Hydrodynamics, using a variety of particle methods
+ Planetary science, with e.g. multiple equations of state
+ Dark Matter
+ Neutrinos
+ Gravity: self-gravity and external potentials
+ Cosmology 
+ Radiative cooling
+ Radiative transfer
+ On-the-fly analysis: halo finding (FOF), power spectra
+ And more!

To enable and use these features, SWIFT needs to be compiled accordingly
and corresponding flags need to be passed at runtime. Please consult the 
instructions provided in the `documentation <https://swiftsim.com/docs>`_ 
for full details.
