SWIFT Onboarding Guide
======================

This is an onboarding guide for SWIFT that can be found on `swiftsim.com/onboarding.pdf`.

You will need the `sphinx` and python package (pip install it), as well as a working
TeX distribution.

To build the documentation (from this directory), run ``make latexpdf`` and the output
files will be created in `build/latex/`.
