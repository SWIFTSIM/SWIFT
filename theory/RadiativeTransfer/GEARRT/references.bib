  abstract = {We present two new Lagrangian methods for hydrodynamics, in a systematic comparison with moving-mesh, SPH, and stationary (non-moving) grid methods. The new methods are designed to simultaneously capture advantages of both smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) and grid-based/adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) schemes. They are based on a kernel discretization of the volume coupled to a high-order matrix gradient estimator and a Riemann solver acting over the volume 'overlap.' We implement and test a parallel, second-order version of the method with self-gravity \& cosmological integration, in the code GIZMO: this maintains exact mass, energy and momentum conservation; exhibits superior angular momentum conservation compared to all other methods we study; does not require 'artificial diffusion' terms; and allows the fluid elements to move with the flow so resolution is automatically adaptive. We consider a large suite of test problems, and find that on all problems the new methods appear competitive with moving-mesh schemes, with some advantages (particularly in angular momentum conservation), at the cost of enhanced noise. The new methods have many advantages vs. SPH: proper convergence, good capturing of fluid-mixing instabilities, dramatically reduced 'particle noise' \& numerical viscosity, more accurate sub-sonic flow evolution, \& sharp shock-capturing. Advantages vs. non-moving meshes include: automatic adaptivity, dramatically reduced advection errors \& numerical overmixing, velocity-independent errors, accurate coupling to gravity, good angular momentum conservation and elimination of 'grid alignment' effects. We can, for example, follow hundreds of orbits of gaseous disks, while AMR and SPH methods break down in a few orbits. However, fixed meshes minimize 'grid noise.' These differences are important for a range of astrophysical problems.},

The weak renormalized meshfree scheme, built from the weak formulation of general conservation laws, turns out to be \$L\^2\$ stable under some geometrical conditions on the distribution of particles and some regularity conditions of the transport field. A time discretization is then performed by analogy with finite volume methods, and the \$L\^1\$, \$L\^\textbackslash{}infty\$, and \$BV\$ stabilities of the obtained time discretized scheme are studied. From the same analogy with finite volume methods, a hybrid particle scheme is built using the Godunov method and is numerically compared to the weak renormalized scheme.},

  abstract = {This work aims to present our current best physical understanding of common-envelope evolution (CEE). We highlight areas of consensus and disagreement, and stress ideas which should point the way forward for progress in this important but long-standing and largely unconquered problem. Unusually for CEE-related work, we mostly try to avoid relying on results from population synthesis or observations, in order to avoid potentially being misled by previous misunderstandings. As far as possible we debate all the relevant issues starting from physics alone, all the way from the evolution of the binary system immediately before CEE begins to the processes which might occur just after the ejection of the envelope. In particular, we include extensive discussion about the energy sources and sinks operating in CEE, and hence examine the foundations of the standard energy formalism. Special attention is also given to comparing the results of hydrodynamic simulations from different groups and to discussing the potential effect of initial conditions on the differences in the outcomes. We compare current numerical techniques for the problem of CEE and also whether more appropriate tools could and should be produced (including new formulations of computational hydrodynamics, and attempts to include 3D processes within 1D codes). Finally we explore new ways to link CEE with observations. We compare previous simulations of CEE to the recent outburst from V1309 Sco, and discuss to what extent post-common-envelope binaries and nebulae can provide information, e.g. from binary eccentricities, which is not currently being fully exploited.},

  abstract = {We present a new implementation of radiation hydrodynamics (RHD) in the adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) code RAMSES. The multigroup radiative transfer (RT) is performed on the AMR grid with a first-order Godunov method using the M1 closure for the Eddington tensor, and is coupled to the hydrodynamics via non-equilibrium thermochemistry of hydrogen and helium. This moment-based approach has the great advantage that the computational cost is independent of the number of radiative sources - it can even deal with continuous regions of emission such as bound-free emission from gas. As it is built directly into RAMSES, the RT takes natural advantage of the refinement and parallelization strategies already in place. Since we use an explicit advection solver for the radiative transport, the time-step is restricted by the speed of light - a severe limitation that can be alleviated using the so-called reduced speed of light approximation. We propose a rigorous framework to assess the validity of this approximation in various conditions encountered in cosmology and galaxy formation. We finally perform with our newly developed code a complete suite of RHD tests, comparing our results to other RHD codes. The tests demonstrate that our code performs very well and is ideally suited for exploring the effect of radiation on current scenarios of structure and galaxy formation.},

We validate the implementation in a series of tests, which include a morphological assessment of the M1 closure for the Eddington tensor in an astronomically relevant setting, dust absorption in a optically semi-thick medium, direct pressure on gas from ionising radiation, convergence of our radiation diffusion scheme towards resolved optical depths, correct diffusion of a radiation flash and a constant luminosity radiation, and finally, an experiment from Davis et al. of the competition between gravity and radiation pressure in a dusty atmosphere, and the formation of radiative Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities. With the new features, RAMSES-RT can be used for state-of-the-art simulations of radiation feedback from first principles, on galactic and cosmological scales, including not only direct radiation pressure from ionising photons, but also indirect pressure via dust from multi-scattered IR photons reprocessed from higher-energy radiation, both in the optically thin and thick limits.},

purely radiative tests and radiation-hydrodynamics ones. Results. The results show that the physical 
model used in HERACLES for the transfer is fairly accurate in both the diffusion and transport 
limit, but also for semi-transparent regions. Conclusions. This makes HERACLES very well-suited to 
studying many astrophysical problems such as radiative shocks, molecular jets of young stars, 
fragmentation and formation of dense cores in the interstellar medium, and protoplanetary discs.},

  abstract = {The development of radiation hydrodynamical methods that are able to follow gas 
dynamics and radiative transfer self-consistently is key to the solution of many problems in 
numerical astrophysics. Such fluid flows are highly complex, rarely allowing even for approximate 
analytical solutions against which numerical codes can be tested. An alternative validation 
procedure is to compare different methods against each other on common problems, in order to assess 
the robustness of the results and establish a range of validity for the methods. Previously, we 
presented such a comparison for a set of pure radiative transfer tests (i.e. for fixed, non-evolving 
density fields). This is the second paper of the Cosmological Radiative Transfer (RT) Comparison 
Project, in which we compare 9 independent RT codes directly coupled to gasdynamics on 3 relatively 
simple astrophysical hydrodynamics problems: (5) the expansion of an H II region in a uniform 
medium; (6) an ionization front (I-front) in a 1/r2 density profile with a flat core, and (7), the 
photoevaporation of a uniform dense clump. Results show a broad agreement between the different 
methods and no big failures, indicating that the participating codes have reached a certain level of 
maturity and reliability. However, many details still do differ, and virtually every code has showed 
some shortcomings and has disagreed, in one respect or another, with the majority of the results. 
This underscores the fact that no method is universal and all require careful testing of the 
particular features which are most relevant to the specific problem at hand.},

is essential for studies of galaxy formation in a cosmological context. The code incorporates 
radiative cooling for an optically thin, primordial composition gas in ionization equilibrium with a 
user-specified ultraviolet background. We adopt a phenomenological prescription for star formation 
that gradually turns cold, dense, Jeans-unstable gas into collisionless stars, returning supernova 
feedback energy to the surrounding medium. In CDM simulations, some of the baryons that fall into 
dark matter potential wells dissipate their acquired thermal energy and condense into clumps with 
roughly galactic masses. The resulting galaxy population is insensitive to assumptions about star 
formation; we obtain similar baryonic mass functions and galaxy correlation functions from 
simulations with star formation and from simulations without star formation in which we identify 
galaxies directly from the cold, dense gas.},

  abstract = {We present the GRACKLE chemistry and cooling library for astrophysical simulations and
models. GRACKLE provides a treatment of non-equilibrium primordial chemistry and cooling for H, D
and He species, including H2 formation on dust grains; tabulated primordial and metal cooling;
multiple ultraviolet background models; and support for radiation transfer and arbitrary heat
sources. The library has an easily implementable interface for simulation codes written in C, C++
and FORTRAN as well as a PYTHON interface with added convenience functions for semi-analytical
models. As an open-source project, GRACKLE provides a community resource for accessing and
disseminating astrochemical data and numerical methods. We present the full details of the core
functionality, the simulation and PYTHON interfaces, testing infrastructure, performance and range
of applicability. GRACKLE is a fully open-source project and new contributions are welcome.},

  abstract = {We present a new approach to numerically model continuum radiative transfer based on
the Optically Thin Variable Eddington Tensor (OTVET) approximation. Our method insures the exact
conservation of the photon number and flux (in the explicit formulation) and automatically switches
from the optically thick to the optically thin regime. It scales as N log N with the number of
hydrodynamic resolution elements and is independent of the number of sources of ionizing radiation
(i.e. works equally fast for an arbitrary source function). We also describe an implementation of
the algorithm in a Soften Lagrangian Hydrodynamic code (SLH) and a multi-frequency approach
appropriate for hydrogen and helium continuum opacities. We present extensive tests of our method
for single and multiple sources in homogeneous and inhomogeneous density distributions, as well as a
realistic simulation of cosmological reionization.},
