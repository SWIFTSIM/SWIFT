get_eigenvalues.f90:
    Compute the Eigenvalues for the M1 radiative transfer Riemann solver.

    Original file provided by Matthias Gonz√°lez, was used in HERACLES code 
    (ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007A%26A...464..429G).
    See the paper for more details on how they are computed. The resulting
    figure in here should give the same results as Fig. 1. in the paper.

Makefile:
    Make get_eigenvalues.f90

plot_eigenvalues.py:
    Creates the plots given a ``eigenvals.txt`` results file, which gets
    generated by compiling and running get_eigenvalues.f90

run.sh:
    compile and run th program to get eigenvalues, plot results.
