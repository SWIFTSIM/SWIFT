Usage:
    analysedumpcells.py nx ny nx cell<1>.dat cell<2>.dat ...

Analyses a number of output files created by calls to the dumpCells() debug
function (presumably called in engine_step()) to output a list of active
top-level cells, identifying those that are on the edges of the volumes being
processed on by various nodes. The point is that these should be minimised to
reduce the MPI communications.

The nx, ny and nz arguments are the number of cells in the complete space,
we need these so that we can wrap around the edge of space correctly.
