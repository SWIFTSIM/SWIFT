# Define the parameters of the zoom region
ZoomRegion:
  enable: 1                         # Turn on the zoom code.
  region_pad_factor: 1.25            # How much larger the zoom region will be than the high res particle distribution in the ICs?
  zoom_top_level_cells: 16          # How many top level cells should the zoom region be resolved with? (superceeds Scheduler:max_top_level_cells which is unused when a zoom region is turned on)
  bkg_top_level_cells: 8           # How many cells should the background be resolved with?
  region_buffer_cell_ratio: 0       # How many buffer cells should be in the zoom region? (if 0 buffer cells are ignored)
