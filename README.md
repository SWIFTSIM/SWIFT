SWIFT: SPH WIth Fine-grained inter-dependent Tasking
====================================================

[![Build Status](https://gitlab.cosma.dur.ac.uk/jenkins/job/GNU%20SWIFT%20build/badge/icon)](https://gitlab.cosma.dur.ac.uk/jenkins/job/GNU%20SWIFT%20build/)

SWIFT is a gravity and SPH solver designed to run cosmological simulations
on peta-scale machines, scaling well up to 10's of thousands of compute
node.

More general information about SWIFT is available on the project
[webpages](http://www.swiftsim.com).

For information on how to _run_ SWIFT, please consult the onboarding guide
available [here](http://www.swiftsim.com/onboarding.pdf). This includes
dependencies, and a few examples to get you going.

We suggest that you use the latest release branch of SWIFT, rather than the
current master branch as this will change rapidly. We do, however, like to
ensure that the master branch will build and run.

This GitHub repository is designed to be an issue tracker, and a space for
the public to submit patches through pull requests. It is synchronised with
the main development repository that is available on the
[ICC](http://icc.dur.ac.uk)'s GitLab server which is available
[here](https://gitlab.cosma.dur.ac.uk/swift/swiftsim).

Please feel free to submit issues to this repository, or even pull
requests. We will try to deal with them as soon as possible, but as the
core development team is quite small this could take some time.

Disclaimer
----------

We would like to emphasise that SWIFT comes without any warranty of accuracy,
correctness or efficiency. As mentioned in the license, the software comes
`as-is` and the onus is on the user to get meaningful results. Whilst the
authors will endeavour to answer questions related to using the code, we
recommend users build and maintain their own copies. This documentation contains
the most basic information to get started. Reading it and possibly also the
source code is the best way to start running simulations.

The users are responsible to understand what the code is doing and for the
results of their simulation runs.

Note also that the values of the parameters given in the examples are only
indicative. We recommend users experiment by themselves and a campaign of
experimentation with various values is highly encouraged. Each problem will
likely require different values and the sensitivity to the details of the
physical model is something left to the users to explore.

Acknowledgment & Citation
-------------------------

In order to keep track of usage and measure the impact of the software, we
kindly ask users publishing scientific results using SWIFT to add the following
sentence to the acknowledgment section of their papers:

"The research in this paper made use of the SWIFT open-source
simulation code (http://www.swiftsim.com, Schaller et al. 2018)
version X.Y.Z."

with the version number set to the version used for the simulations and the
reference pointing to the ASCL entry of the code: https://ascl.net/1805.020.



Contribution Guidelines
-----------------------

The SWIFT source code uses a variation of the 'Google' formatting style.
The script 'format.sh' in the root directory applies the clang-format-10
tool with our style choices to all the SWIFT C source file. Please apply
the formatting script to the files before submitting a pull request.

Please check that the test suite still runs with your changes applied before
submitting a pull request and add relevant unit tests probing the correctness
of new modules. An example of how to add a test to the suite can be found by
considering the tests/testGreeting case.

Any contributions that fail any of the automated tests will not be accepted.
Contributions that include tests of the proposed modules (or any current ones!)
are highly encouraged.
